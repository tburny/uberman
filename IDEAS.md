# Ideas Collection

**Purpose**: Collect rough ideas from user or discovered during work.

**NOT planned work. NOT commitments. Just collection.**

---

## User Ideas

(User adds ideas here as they come up)

---

## Discovered During Refactoring

(Ideas that emerge during implementation - not committed to)

---

## How to Use This File

1. **Write ideas down** as they come (user or during development)
2. **Don't evaluate or prioritize** - just capture
3. **Let ideas sit** - important ones will resurface naturally
4. **Shape during cooldown** - if idea keeps coming back, write a pitch
5. **Let most ideas die** - that's intentional and good

**Shape Up principle**: Ideas that matter will resurface. Unimportant ideas naturally disappear.

## What NOT to Do

- ❌ Turn this into a backlog (no grooming, no priorities)
- ❌ Feel guilty about ideas not implemented
- ❌ Create tasks or stories from these ideas
- ❌ Treat this as commitment or plan

**This is NOT a backlog. It's an idea graveyard where good ideas occasionally resurrect.**
